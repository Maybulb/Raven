# Raven
Only this and nothing more.

## About

Raven is a network to share poetry, and all the creative ideas that come with it. It includes social elements such as commenting and annotation, but is not intended to be a traditional social network, but instead a modern medium between poets and people.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ravenpoetry/raven

cd raven && npm i
node index.js
```
