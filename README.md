# Raven
Only this and nothing more.

## About

Raven is a network to share poetry, and all the creative ideas that come with it. It includes social elements such as commenting and annotation, but is not intended to be a traditional social networkâ€“ instead serving as a modern medium between poets and readers.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ravenpoetry/raven

cd raven && npm i
node index.js
```

## API Routes/Map

Current roadmap, and will be updated in the future to support a public API which can be used by users, and will likely be used with our iOS app.

If the user is logged in, will bring them to the home page.

If the user is not logged in it will bring them to the main index with Raven's description, as well as login/register buttons.

### `GET /post`
Returns the page to post a poem. Redirects to login if the user is not authenticated.

### `POST /post`
Takes 2 parameters through body (`title`, `body`), and creates a `Poem` object with the following model.

	preview: String
}
